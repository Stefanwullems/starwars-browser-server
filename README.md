# Starwars Browser

This is the server for the Starwars Browser webapp.  
The reason this app exists is because I am currently exploring the .NET framework.

Server: C#, ASP.NET  
Client: Typescript, React

During this project got to play around a bit with http requests and asynchonous methods in .NET and C# because the backend is connected to the SWAPI (Star Wars API). On the frontend my main focus was to make things look good and keeping my code as clean as possible.
