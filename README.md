# Starwars Browser

This is the server for the Starwars Browser webapp.  
The reason this app exists is because I am currently exploring the .NET framework.

Server: C#, ASP.NET  
Client: Typescript, React

During this project got to play around a bit with http requests and asynchonous methods in .NET and C# because all the data is initially fetched from the SWAPI (Star Wars API) and migrated into the datatbase. On the frontend my main focus was to make things look good, keeping my code as clean as possible and get the typing for react and redux right.
